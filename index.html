            <p>Beck was born on December 3rd. She was born and raised on Nantucket Island.Her father was an addict and she saw a lot of unpleasant times as a child because of his addiction. This included finding him overdosed with a needle in his arm when she was 12 years old. Her parents divorced after this and her father abandoned her family, however, she told everyone he died the day she found him.</p>

                    It's clearly a gimmick, the writing is so bad. I think everybody that likes the show was hoping they would put that book out for real, even though the character of Beck isn't a real person.
